# CMS Tracker DPG Knowledge Transfer Material

This is an attempt to aggregate information gathered while working on software used by the CMS TkDPG group. It contains information regarding CMSSW code, both for CPU and GPU implementations, along with information on projects like CertHelper and MLPlayground.

This documentation ^^does not aim to replace existing pages or other existing documentation^^, but to 
cherry-pick useful information and have it one place.

Use the sidebar to navigate through the available sections.

	on [github](https://github.com/CMSTrackerDPG/cms-tkdpg-software-knowledge-transfer)), 
	as it will definitely be missing insights, details or whole pieces of information.
