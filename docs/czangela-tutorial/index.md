<!-- I wasn't sure how to start knowledge transfer. -->

<!-- In this previous approach I started creating a course to cover `CUDA` basics and make the reader familiar with `CMSSW`. -->

<!-- It was the wrong approach.

No one told me so, not because they didn't see what I was doing, but because they didn't know what I should be doing.

It is hard when there is no management or the management doesn't know what should happen. One could argue that the two are the same.

So I won't be the one creating already available content for some people not doing their part of the work using already existing resources.  -->

<!-- Don't worry A, you did an awesome job, even if you don't realize it now :) -->

This is an effort to introduce CUDA and GPU programming in the scope of CMSSW.

Generic CUDA resources and CMSSW examples and exercises can be found, split into
parts that one can follow on their own pace.
