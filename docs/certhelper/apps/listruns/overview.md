# listruns app

This is an app which handles:

* Listing the runs which have already been certified (`listruns`) and
* Updating information on existing `TrackerCertification` instances
([`UpdateRunView`](views/updaterun.md)).

!!! warning
	
	No idea why this is not integrated into the `certifier` app.
	Could be a good idea to merge those at some point.
