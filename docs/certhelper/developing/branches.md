## Overview

There are three main branches in the repository, each with its own
importance:

- `master` branch, which contains code which is 
  {==thoroughly tested==} and production-ready, meaning
  as few bugs as possible (if not zero). CertHelper's production instance
  builds from this branch.
- `training` branch, which should be synchronized with the `master` branch
  at all times. It contains minor changes which make it useful for training
  new Shifters. CertHelper's training instance builds from this branch.
- `develop` branch, where all development takes place. CertHelper's development
  instance builds from this branch.
