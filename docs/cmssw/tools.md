# Tools

It all starts with `cmsRun` which is the main entry point to all CMSSW code.
Configuring it can be a pain so, for this reason, `cmsDriver` was built.
Still, configuring `cmsDriver` can also be tedious for pipelines that require
multiple steps of data fetching, configuring, simulating etc., so `runTheMatrix.py`
was developed.

Those tools are available on LXPLUS machines, after creating a work area
and [activating a CMSSW environment by `cmsenv`](working-with-cmssw/software.md#create-a-cmssw-area).

## `scram`

A software build and maintenance tool. 

It can [build](working-with-cmssw/software.md#building-the-code),
[check](working-with-cmssw/software.md#running-checks-on-the-code)
and [format](working-with-cmssw/software.md#formatting-the-code) the code.

Documentation on `scram` can be found [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideScram). 

## `cmsRun`

!!! todo
	
	TODO
	
The main entrypoint to execute CMSSW code. Probably never run by hand, it requires
complicated [configuration files](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookConfigFileIntro) 
to execute which are generated by other tools, described below.

## `cmsDriver.py`

!!! todo
	
	TODO

A Python tool to create `cmsRun` configuration files, which are in the form of Python3 code.

## `runTheMatrix.py`

A wrapper script which is responsible of executing multi-step analysis/simulation recipes
by configuring `cmsDriver`.

It is examined in more detail [in the Workflows section](working-with-cmssw/workflows/overview.md)
