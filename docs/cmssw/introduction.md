# Introduction

CMSSW is a monster which contains a multitude of algorithms and tools,
all in one repository (not exactly a
[monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) but close).

Looking around for information on its structure and use you can very easily
get lost, frustrated, mad even, as most information is either too cryptic,
outdated or both. This document will try to focus on the very few files that
are of interest to the TkDPG group.
